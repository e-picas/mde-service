The `mde-api.php` script of this directory is an example of implementation of the
`MdeService` webservice. You can make a copy of the interface to build your own.

The `.htaccess` file defines some common rules to let the server handle the *MdeService*
requests. If you include the interface with other files in the same directory, you may
modify the rewrite rules of this file.
